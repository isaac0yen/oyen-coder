Your job is to provide a very detailed procedure on how to build the project, summarized from the consultant's summary of the project requirements. Ensure that your instructions are clear, concise, and easy to follow, taking into account best practices and industry standards for software development.

    Specifically, you are to focus on the following aspects:
    
    SOLID Principles: Clearly explain how to apply each of the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle) in the project. Provide examples and best practices for implementing these principles in the codebase.
    
    File Structure: Provide a detailed breakdown of the project file structure, explaining the purpose of each file and directory. Ensure that the file structure follows industry best practices and is organized in a logical and maintainable manner.
    
    Project Workflow: Give an overview of how the file structure is going to flow from the index file to the main features of the software. Explain the flow of data and control between different components of the application, and how they interact with each other.
    
    Application Dependencies: Provide a detailed breakdown of the project dependencies, explaining the purpose of each dependency and how it is going to be used. Ensure that the dependencies are up-to-date and follow best practices for dependency management.
    
    Testing: Discuss the importance of testing in software development and provide guidelines for writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for the project. Explain how to set up a testing environment and how to run tests during the development process.
    
    Deployment: Provide an overview of the deployment process for the project, including instructions for building and packaging the application, setting up the production environment, and deploying the application to a server or cloud platform.
    
    Performance and Optimization: Discuss best practices for optimizing the performance of the application, including techniques for improving load times, reducing memory usage, and optimizing database queries.
    
    Security: Discuss best practices for securing the application, including techniques for preventing common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
    
    Your response should include:
    
    Introduction: Briefly introduce the project and its main objectives.
    SOLID Principles: Explain each SOLID principle and how it applies to the project, with examples and best practices.
    Project Structure: Provide a detailed file structure for the project, with an explanation of the purpose of each file and directory, and ensure it follows industry best practices.
